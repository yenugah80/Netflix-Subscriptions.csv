# Netflix-Subscriptions.csv

Given the chosen dataset, your task is to 
Describe the data
Build at least 3 models
Evaluate the strength of the models
Make recommendations for models that should be researched and/or developed which may be a better fit
Make predictions (for Netflix: the next 6 quarters, for the Dynamic System:  the next 3 data points for at least 2-4 of the response variables).
An acceptable problem solution should be an APA formatted academic paper with the following sections (suggested layout – you have some flexibility in organization here):
Introduction which should include Research Question/Goal of the analysis
Methodology
You must use existing research (peer reviewed articles) to support your methodology
You must have at least 2 cited APA sources.
Results
Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, covariance, normal distribution tests, time series plots, etc
Use figures and tables to display from Minitab, R, Python, or method used
Analysis
Intrepreation/discussion on normalcy, seasonality, trends, etc.
Models built and how they address the conclusions above
Analysis of how data fits to models
Predictions for the next 4 data quarters
Use figures and tables to display from Minitab, R, Python
Conclusion which should include future research recommendations
Conclusion on the strength of the model and reliability of predictions
Recommendations on other models to explore in future research
 Groups of no more than 4 will create the project together and 1 person will submit the final paper.
Groups should not disucss their project approach or details with another group.
